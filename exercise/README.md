CDP Day 1 Exercise:

- Implement the functionality for all the methods in all the files inside the services folder.
- Import the functions in the root index.js and invoke them to test if your code is working.

To run the local development server, run the ff:

1. npm install
2. npm start

npm install will install the dependencies of the create-react-app project and create a node_modules folder. We typically don't include the node_modules folder whenever we share our projects to anyone / when we push our code to remote repository (gitlab, github)
